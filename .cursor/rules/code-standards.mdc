 # Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for all code files
- Follow functional programming patterns where possible
- Implement proper error handling with informative messages
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper logging for debugging
- Write code that is testable and maintainable

# Prohibited Patterns
- DO NOT use Bun-specific APIs that won't work in Node.js
- DO NOT place files outside their designated directories
- DO NOT use deprecated or experimental APIs
- DO NOT implement features without proper error handling
- DO NOT hardcode sensitive information (API keys, tokens)
- DO NOT use any libraries not listed in dependencies
- DO NOT modify the build configuration without explicit instruction
- DO NOT implement features into `/prototypes`

# Required Behavior
- ALWAYS validate user input
- ALWAYS provide helpful error messages
- ALWAYS follow the existing code patterns
- ALWAYS implement proper type checking
- ALWAYS handle edge cases
- ALWAYS provide clear documentation
- ALWAYS respect the project structure
