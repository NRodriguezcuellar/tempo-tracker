Currently the only things we can do with worklogs is syncing them. If we don't have a configuration set we can't do anything with the worklogs.

I want the user to be able to see the worklogs they have tracked in the extension, so they can see what they have tracked and when they have tracked it.
it should work with the activity command using 'activity list' to list all the worklogs. It should be displayed in a nice way with the date, duration, description, issue key and branch name.
Maybe in a table format.
